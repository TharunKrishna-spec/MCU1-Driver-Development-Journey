# MCU1 Driver Development – My Learning Journey

This repository contains all notes, code implementations, diagrams and experiments from the FastBit Embedded Academy course "Mastering Microcontroller with Embedded Driver Development (MCU1)."

## Goals
- Build deep embedded foundations
- Write STM32 drivers from scratch
- Understand GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, Interrupts, RCC
- Reduce AI-dependency and write real embedded code
- Prepare for IoT + Edge AI career

## Week Plan
- Week 1: MCU architecture + GPIO driver
- Week 2: UART driver
- Week 3: SPI driver
- Week 4: I2C driver
- Week 5: Interrupts + NVIC
- Week 6: Debugging + Final Projects

More updates soon...
